# AC-Project-1-FPGA_CPU
First Project for Subject: Computer Architecture.

This project implements a basic processor with a minimal instruction set using VHDL. The design is developed in Vivado ML Edition, simulated with Vivado Simulator, and tested on an Artix-7 FPGA. The processor operates with 8-bit data and follows the provided block diagram.
